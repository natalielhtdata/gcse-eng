1,"""Mr Fisher remembered a time – surely, not so long ago – when books were golden, when imaginations soared, when the world was filled with stories which ran like gazelles and pounced like tigers and exploded like rockets, illuminating minds and hearts. He had seen it happen; had seen whole classes swept away in the fever. In those days, there were heroes; there were dragons and dinosaurs; there were space adventurers and soldiers of fortune and giant apes. In those days, thought Mr Fisher, we dreamed in colour, though films were in black and white, and good always triumphed in the end.""","""AQA 2018 P1Q2 How does the writer use language here to convey Mr Fisher/s views on books and stories of the past?""                                                                                  ","""Harris uses a metaphor to clearly illustrate Fisher's passion for stories. Stories are consistently said to be like animals: 'tigers', 'gazelles'. This sugests that each story is unique and special in its own way and this is why Fisher loves then. The similie 'pounced like tigers' shows he is stimulated by stories. The verb 'pounced' suggests aggression and commitment, reflect Fisher's passion and commitment for them. However, the comparison to endangered animals like 'tigers' and 'gazelles' reflects Fishers' and ultimately the writer's overraching fear that stories are becoming endangered. Yet Harrision says that they 'illuminate minds and hearts' suggesting that they will always remain integral and important to us. Harris also use repetition to show Fisher's continued love for stories. The repetition of 'In those days' shows how the love and happy memories of stories are overwhelming and this shines in his perpetual dedication for them. However the use of the past tense gives an underlying sense of loss and despair in Fisher that he feels lost without the wonders of his stories yet. Harris reinforces his committed love by giving a hopeful declarative at the end: 'good always triumphed in the end' suggesting that he believes that they will come again like 'rockets' and 'heroes', the underlying theme of the source."""
2,"""Rosie had made a quick check of the unfamiliar garden before letting the children go out to
play. The bottom half of the garden was an overgrown mess, a muddle of trees and
shrubs. An ancient mulberry tree stood at the centre. Its massive twisted branches
drooped to the ground in places, its knuckles in the earth like a gigantic malformed hand.
The wintry sun hung low in the sky and the gnarled growth threw long twisted shadows
across the undergrowth within its cage. The trunk of the tree was snarled with the tangled
ivy that grew up through the broken bricks and chunks of cement, choking it. The path that
led down towards the fence at the bottom, which marked the garden off from an orchard
beyond, disappeared into a mass of nettles and brambles before it reached the padlocked
door. ""","""AQA 2020 P1Q2 How does the writer use language here to describe the garden?
""",""" In the passage, the writer uses a range of language techniques to describe the garden. The
passage has a consistent theme of personification to describe the garden and the different
plants and trees in it. The ‘ancient mulberry tree’ is described as being ‘stood’ in the centre,
which suggests it is looming over the garden, right in the middle, almost as if it is protecting the
garden; a supernatural force of nature. Furthermore, with the phrase ‘the gnarled growth threw
long, twisted shadows’, the writer creates dark and foreboding imagery. The personification in
the words ‘gnarled’ and ‘twisted’ also suggests anger and bitterness, further contributing to the
tension of the passage as Rosie journeys towards the locked door. The writer describes the ivy
as ‘choking’ the tree as it was ‘snarled’ with it, and this imagery suggests that the garden is
almost at war with itself, and is in chaos. The descriptive language here once again has
connotations of vindictiveness and anger, as if the garden is angry and sprawling, which further
builds the tension of the text.
Furthermore, the writer uses metaphorical language and similes throughout the passage in
order to describe the garden. The writer uses a metaphor and simile to describe the huge tree in
the garden, in ‘its knuckles in the earth like a gigantic malformed hand’. This personification in
the comparison of the tree to a hand, through ‘malformed hand’ and ‘knuckles’, allows the
reader to intensely imagine the scene. The connotations of these words are harsh and unwelcoming, even scary, and the reader is left feeling like the garden is an unfriendly and
terrifying place. Furthermore, the theme of anger in the description of the garden is continued
here, through the word ‘knuckles’ which carries the connotation of a punch or a fight, and we are
left once again with the sense that the garden is at war with itself, the plants constantly twisting
and turning with each other."""
3,"""Kino's breath whistled in his nostrils and he opened his mouth to stop it. And then the startled look was gone from him and the rigidity from his body. In his mind a new song had come, the Song of Evil, the music of the enemy, of any foe of the family, a savage, secret, dangerous melody, and underneath, the Song of the Family cried plaintively. The scorpion moved delicately down the rope toward the box. Under her breath Juana repeated an ancient magic to guard against such evil, and on top of that she muttered a Hail Mary between clenched teeth. But Kino was in motion. His body glided quietly across the room, noiselessly and smoothly. His hands were in front of him, palms down, and his eyes were on the scorpion. Beneath it in the hanging box Coyotito laughed and reached up his hand toward it. It sensed danger when Kino was almost within reach of it. It stopped, and its tail rose up over its back in little jerks and the curved thorn on the tail's end glistened. Kino stood perfectly still. He could not move until the scorpion moved, and it felt for the source of the death that was coming to it. Kino's hand went forward very slowly, very smoothly. The thorned tail jerked upright.""","""AQA 2022 P1Q2 How does the writer use language here to describe the conflict between Kino and the
scorpion? ""","""In the lines mentioned in the question, the writer uses an extended metaphor of the ‘Song of
the Family’ and the ‘Song of Evil’. This language technique helps to juxtapose the good, Kino
and Juana, with the evil, the scorpion. In this way, it is clear that the family are portrayed as the
innocent victims, whereas the scorpion is presented as the aggressor. This is reinforced by the
adverb ‘plaintively’, used alongside the emotive verb ‘cried’, which stresses the innocence of the
family faced with the threat from the scorpion. In addition, through this extended metaphor, the
two involved parties are presented in capital letters, which helps to create clearly defined sides
to the situation, almost as if it is a literal conflict in itself, with forces on either side.
Furthermore, the threat of the scorpion is emphasised through the rule of three in the line ‘a
savage, secret, dangerous melody’. This technique helps to portray the hazard carried by the
scorpion, and highlights the danger that the family find themselves in. The alliteration of the ‘s’ in
the same sentence resembles a hushing sound, which illustrates the parents’ intentions to
remain silent, so as not to frighten the scorpion into delivering the stinging blow. This sibilance
helps to create a vivid imagery of the conflict. To add to this, the scenario developing in the
source is mirrored by the use of the word ‘melody’. This word, normally associated with a
peaceful and sweet meaning, takes on a harsh tone, accentuated by the sinister adjectives
‘savage’ and ‘dangerous’. This in turn casts a threatening light on the conflict. In addition, the writer uses the senses of sight and sound to build tension and suspense within
the narrative. For example, the onomatopoeic use of the word ‘whistled’, coupled with the
adverb ‘noiselessly’, really emphasise the quietness further, by creating vivid images in the
reader’s mind. This creates the impression that Kino is firmly locked in and focused on the
scene, and that no background noise is able to distract him."""
4,"""I am not one to hold a prejudice against any animal, but it is a plain fact that the
spotted hyena is not well served by its appearance. It is ugly beyond redemption.
Its shaggy, coarse coat is a bungled mix of colours, with the spots having none of
the classy ostentation of a leopard’s, they look rather like the symptoms of a skin
disease. The head is broad and too massive, with a high forehead, like that of a
bear, but suffering from a receding hairline, and with ears that look ridiculously
mouse-like, large and round, when they haven’t been torn off in battle. The mouth
is forever open and panting. The nostrils are too big. The tail is scraggly and
unwagging. All the parts put together look doglike, but like no dog anyone would
want as a pet.""","""AQA 2023 P1Q2 How does the writer use language here to describe the hyena’s appearance?""","""The writer uses evaluative language to present the hyena’s appearance as completely unacceptable. The phrase “it is a plain fact” that the hyena is “ugly beyond redemption” suggests that its appearance cannot be excused or improved. “Ugly beyond redemption” implies that the animal is so repulsive it deserves to be condemned, as if its looks are a permanent flaw.

Adjectives are used to describe the hyena’s fur as a “shaggy, coarse coat,” which suggests it is rough and unpleasant to look at. Contrast is used when this is followed by a “bungled mix of colours.” The verb “bungled” implies a failed attempt at beauty, which portrays the hyena as a scruffy, mismatched creature. This reinforces the idea that its appearance is unnatural.

The description also implies that the hyena’s outer ugliness reflects an inner unpleasantness. The combination of these features suggests that its appearance has been shaped by something deeper — that it is not only physically unattractive but wrong on a symbolic level. This builds a strong impression of something that should be rejected.

A simile is used to describe the hyena’s spots as looking “like the symptoms of a skin disease.” This comparison implies its appearance is diseased and disturbing, making it seem not just ugly but physically revolting. Contrast is used again when the hyena is compared to the “classy ostentation of a leopard,” which highlights how far it falls short of beauty.

Several details criticise the hyena’s appearance, having a “too massive” head and “suffering from a receding hairline” and “ears that look ridiculously mouse like,” which suggest that it is a monstrous beast, both ugly and disgusting. Exaggeration is used to make its proportions seem unnatural, and personification is used to mock it, as though it has human flaws. The word “ridiculously” adds humour, portraying the hyena as both mismatched and absurd."""
5,"""This was an uncharacteristically gloomy train of thought, and Mr Fisher pushed it away.
Not all his boys lacked imagination. Alistair Tibbet, for instance, even though he had
obviously done part of his homework on the bus. An amiable boy, this Tibbet. Not a
brilliant scholar by any means, but there was a spark in him which deserved attention.
Mr Fisher took a deep breath and looked down at Tibbet’s exercise book, trying not to think
of the snow outside and the five o’clock bus he was now almost certain to miss. Four
books to go, he told himself; and then home; dinner; bed; the comforting small routine of a
winter weekend.
But, gradually sitting there in the warm classroom with the smell of chalk and floor polish in
his nostrils, Mr Fisher began to experience a very strange sensation. It began as a
tightening in his diaphragm, as if a long unused muscle had been brought into action. His
breathing quickened, stopped, quickened again. He began to sweat. And when he
reached the end of the story, Mr Fisher put down his red pen and went back to the
beginning, re-reading every word very slowly and with meticulous care. This must be what a prospector feels when, discouraged and bankrupt and ready to go
home, he takes off his boot and shakes out a nugget of gold the size of his fist. He read it
again, critically this time, marking off the paragraphs with notes in red. A hope, which at
first Mr Fisher had hardly dared to formulate, swelled in him and grew strong. He found
himself beginning to smile.
If anyone had asked him what Tibbet’s story was about, Mr Fisher might have been hard
put to reply. There were themes he recognised, elements of plot which were vaguely
familiar: an adventure – a quest, a child, a man. But to explain Tibbet’s story in these terms
was as meaningless as trying to describe a loved one’s face in terms of nose, eyes, mouth.
This was something new. Something entirely original.""","""AQA 2018 P1Q4 A student said, ‘This part of the story, where Mr Fisher is marking homework,
shows Tibbet’s story is better than Mr Fisher expected, and his reaction is
extreme.’
To what extent do you agree?
In your response, you could:
• consider your own impressions of what Mr Fisher expected Tibbet’s
homework to be like
• evaluate how the writer conveys Mr Fisher’s reaction to what he discovers
• support your response with references to the text. ""","""I agree with the student’s statement to some extent that Mr Fisher’s reaction is extreme,
however, it is also realistic as the passage shows the absolute joy that stories can bring to
people. Initially, Mr Fisher does not seem overly enthusiastic about reading Alistair Tibbet’s
story. He comments that Tibbet is not a ‘brilliant scholar by any means’ and ‘had obviously done
part of his homework on the bus,’ indicating that Tibbet does not prioritise his studies. In this
way, the reader can see that Mr Fisher does not have high expectations regarding his piece of
homework. Though he recognises Tibbet’s imagination as different from the other boys in the
class, due to the ‘spark in him which deserved attention,’ Mr Fisher is preoccupied with his own
domestic routine. The trio of ‘home; dinner; bed,’ and the fact he only had ‘four books to go’
highlights that he would much rather finish the task quickly so that he can resume his comforting
domestic schedule.
The shift that takes place in the next paragraph explores Mr Fisher’s strong reaction to reading
the story. His physical response could be considered extreme, as Harris incorporates complex
sentences detailing the impact of the story within the text. The statement that, ‘It began as a
tightening in his diaphragm, as if a long unused muscle had been brought into action’, highlights
the start of his excitement in reading the story. The detail of the unused muscle is indicative that
no stories have made Mr Fisher react in this way for a long time. The choice to link the
diaphragm to this renewed sense of passion, as a muscle linked to breathing and respiration,indicates the life-giving power which the story has upon Mr Fisher. Therefore, though extreme,
the reader may share in the fact that his passion has been reignited.
His astonishment may be rooted in the fact that he sees Tibbet’s story as something ‘entirely
original’. Thus the reader can even more deeply understand why he responds in such a physical
manner. Juxtaposition of long and short sentences shows Mr Fisher’s epiphany that Tibbet has
crafted a brilliant story, particularly as he ‘put down his red pen and went back to the beginning,
re-reading every word very slowly and with meticulous care’. In this way, the initial rush of
physical excitement is complemented by his treatment of the work with slow and meticulous
care, evidencing that Mr Fisher is in complete awe.
Harris’ use of the metaphor of the prospector to highlight the sense of triumphant discovery also
contributes to the impression of extremity in Mr Fisher’s reaction. His comparison to a gold
digger who was ‘discouraged and bankrupt and ready to go home’ before finding ‘a nugget of
gold the size of his fist’, demonstrates that the story is almost like a precious treasure. His joy at
this finding is made more extreme as it provides a true contrast to the gloom of his initial
attitude. The sense of hope Mr Fisher feels is especially powerful, as it ‘swelled in him and grew
strong’. The reader wants to share in this hope. Hence, the severity of Mr Fisher’s reaction is
realistic to his situation, as previously he had felt resigned to his students’ lack of imagination,
and passion for the subject.
Overall, I agree with the student that the reaction is extreme, however it is understandable in the
wider context of the text. The overtly disillusioned Mr Fisher is filled with hope that Tibbet’s
imagination meant that something new was taking place within storytelling, and that the
imaginative ability he possesses indicates hope for the future."""
6,"""A little girl was sitting back on her heels beside a clump of daisies that grew against the
fence. She had her back to Rosie and was holding tight to the handle of a large wicker
basket that stood on the ground beside her. Cara seemed unfazed by the girl’s presence
and continued to move, engrossed, along the row of plants. Rosie bent forward to look
through the clearest of the panes and peered closer. The child was small, maybe around
eight or nine, although something in the tense hunch of her shoulders made her seem
older. Her hair hung down her back in a matted, dusty-looking plait and she was wearing
dressing-up clothes: an ankle-length dress and pinafore in washed-out greys and tans, like
a home-made Cinderella* costume. Something wasn’t right here. She had seen distress in those eyes.
Rosie turned away, dried her hands hurriedly and slipped on her flip-flops. She would go
gently, raise no challenge about her being in the garden but say hello and try to find out
what was the matter. Maybe if she pointed out that her mother would be worrying where
she was, she could persuade the girl to let her take her home.
But when she stepped outside, the child was gone. ""
Where on earth had she come from? She must be a neighbour’s child but how had she got
in? The wooden fences that separated the gardens between each of the houses in the
terrace were high – surely too high for a child to climb.
The child glanced over her shoulder, back towards the houses, a quick, furtive movement
as if she were scanning the upper windows of the row, afraid of being overlooked. Rosie
caught a glimpse of her face, pale and drawn with anxiety, before the girl turned back and
reached forward to quickly tuck a piece of trailing white cloth into the basket. Almost
unconsciously, Rosie registered that the girl was left-handed like herself, and that there was
something animal-like in her movements: quick, like the darting of a mouse or the flit of a
sparrow, some small dun creature that moves fast to blend into the background.","""AQA 2020 P1Q4 A student said, ‘I wasn’t at all surprised by the disappearance of the stranger child at the
end of the extract. The writer has left us in no doubt that she is just part of Rosie’s
imagination.’
To what extent do you agree?
In your response, you could:
• consider the disappearance of the stranger child
• evaluate how the writer presents the stranger child
• support your response with references to the text.""","Despite Rosie’s initial thoughts of the child being real, the writer leaves so many clues
towards the child being imaginary, that we are not surprised at the end of the extract when she
disappears.
In the passage, the writer describes the ‘animal-like’ movements of the stranger child, and the
use of the simile ‘like the darting of a mouse or the flit of a sparrow’ adds depth to the
description and allows the reader to imagine how fast she must be moving. From this, we can
infer that the child is not moving in a human-like way, and that the movements seem
unpredictable and fast. These fast, animal-like movements, however, remain unnoticed by
Rosie’s child Cara, who has no reaction to the girl. The fact that Rosie’s daughter cannot see
the girl suggests that the girl’s movements are not only animal-like, but also that she herself is
not human, and is simply a figment of Rosie’s imagination.
Furthermore, the imagery throughout the passage when describing the girl has connotations
with an old, ghostly figure, as well as fairy-tales. The stranger child’s hair is described as being
tied back in a ‘matted, dusty-looking plait’, and she looked young in height and build, however
something in the ‘hunch of her shoulders made her seem older’. Those readers well-versed in
ghost stories will pick up on the ghostly connotation in this passage. The fact that the girl’s
hunched shoulders made her seem older gives us a clue that this could be a supernatural
being, and thus it would not be surprising to find out that the girl has suddenly ‘gone’ at the end.
Moreover, the use of the simile in ‘like a home-made Cinderella costume’ compares the girl’s
outfit to a well-known fairy-tale, which insinuates that the girl may belong in such a story. As the
reader will know, fairy-tales are often characterised by mystery and magic, and thus the reader
is not surprised when the little girl disappears at the end of the passage.
The writer also structures the text in such a way that gives us clues that the stranger child is
imaginary. The short sentence ‘Something wasn’t right here’, is structured in a one line
paragraph so as to build tension in the narrative, and aims to draw in the reader’s attention to
this line. By drawing our attention into the fact that ‘something wasn’t right’, it is once again
insinuated to us that the child is somewhat abnormal. Furthermore, the repetition of rhetorical
questions asking how the child had entered the garden reflect the impossibility of the situation.
The use of the question ‘how had she got in?’ emphasises the difficulty and impossibility that a
child could have entered the garden, what with the high fences that separated the houses. We are therefore unsurprised by the end of the passage that the child has disappeared, just as
impossibly as she had entered.
Overall, I would agree with the statement, as despite Rosie’s thoughts of the child being real,
the writer peppers clues throughout the structure and language of the text which suggest to us
that she is imaginary, or ghostly."
7,"""Kino's hand leaped to catch it, but it fell past his fingers, fell on the baby's shoulder, landed and.struck. Then, snarling, Kino had it, had it in his fingers, rubbing it to a paste in his hands. He threw it down and beat it into the earth floor with his fist, and Coyotito screamed with pain in his box. But Kino beat and stamped the enemy until it was only a fragment and a moist place in the dirt.” His teeth were bared and fury in his eyes and the Song of the Enemy roared in his ears. But Juana had the baby in her arms now. She found the puncture with redness starting from it already. She put her lips down over the puncture and sucked hard and spat and sucked again while Coyotito screamed. Kino hovered; he was helpless, he was in the way. The screams of the baby brought the neighbours. ""Scorpion. The baby has been stung."" Juana stopped sucking the puncture for a moment. The little hole was slightly enlarged and its edges whitened from the sucking, but the red swelling extended farther around it in a hard lymphatic mound. An adult might be very ill from the sting, but a baby could easily die from the poison. First would come swelling and fever and tightened throat, and then cramps in the stomach, and then Coyotito might die if enough of the poison had gone in. But the stinging pain of the bite was going away. Coyotito's screams turned to moans. Kino had wondered often at the iron in his patient, fragile wife. She, who was obedient and respectful and cheerful and patient, She could stand fatigue and hunger almost better than. Kino himself. She was like a strong man. And now she did a most surprising thing. ""The doctor,"" she said. ""Go to get the doctor."" ""The doctor would not come,"" Kino said to Juana. She looked up at him, her eyes as cold as the eyes of a lioness. This was Juana's first baby. - this was nearly everything there was in Juana's world, and Kino saw her determination. ""Then we will go to him,"" Juana said, and with one hand she arranged her dark blue shawl over her head and made of one end of it a sling to hold the moaning baby and a shade over his eyes to protect him from the light. The people in the doorway pushed against those behind to let her through. Kino followed her.","""AQA 2022 P1Q4 A student said, “In this part of the story, Juana’s reaction to the danger facing their baby is
different to Kino’s. The writer shows that Kino is unhelpful, and it is Juana who tries to
save the baby’s life.”
To what extent do you agree?
In your response, you could:
• consider Juana’s and Kino’s reactions to the danger facing their baby
• evaluate how the writer presents Juana’s and Kino’s different reactions
• support your response with references to the text.""","It cannot be denied that the reactions of Kino and Juana to the danger facing their baby are
very different.
Kino is presented as being more intent on revenge than on protecting the life of his son. After
killing the scorpion, Kino is described as stamping on the scorpion, long after it had been killed,
until it was ‘only a fragment’. This makes it seem as if Kino has no regard for saving his son’s
life, but is more focused on celebrating the death of the scorpion, almost as if he regards the
situation as a personal battle. This viewpoint is reinforced by the use of the emphatic ‘but’ to
start the sentence ‘But Kino beat and stamped the enemy until it was only a fragment and a
moist place in the dirt’. This sentence follows on from ‘Coyotito screamed in pain’ where the use
of the contrasting word ‘but’ to start the sentence stresses that Kino’s actions are in complete
opposition to that of a man trying to do his utmost to save his child. Furthermore, whilst Juana is
taking the necessary steps to try to save her son’s life, the writer’s description of Kino suggests
that he was more of a hindrance than a help: “he was helpless, he was in the way”. The
repetition of ‘he was” in these phrases places great importance on the fact that it was Kino who
was the futile party, rather than his wife.
On the other hand, Juana’s actions are undoubtedly focused on saving her child. Whilst Kino’s
instinctive reaction is to kill the scorpion and assert his supposed dominance over it, Juana’s
first reaction is to tend to the needs of her son, by applying first aid. The writer cleverly uses the
pronoun ‘she’ to emphasise the role that Juana played in performing the life-saving actions: ‘she
found the puncture’ and ‘she put her lips down’ over this puncture. Furthermore, the contrast
between the reactions of the two parents is evident immediately after the actions of Kino have
been described. After Kino’s helplessness is presented, Juana is described as having ‘the baby in her arms now’. The striking point that the reader can infer from this is that this comforting
action already supersedes the response from Kino, highlighting Juana’s strong maternal instinct.
However, the connotation of this is that the baby is now metaphorically in his mother’s control
who will then help to ensure his safety from now on. As a result, the student can be considered
correct in stating that it is solely Juana who tries to save the baby’s life.
However, although Kino’s intentions towards saving his son after the death of the scorpion can
be questioned, it was he who eliminated the threat which could have caused further harm to the
rest of the family in the first place. Although naive in his response and naive in failing to realise
the impact already inflicted by the scorpion, describing him as ‘unhelpful’ may be extreme and
exaggerated. Despite adopting different roles during the process, they ultimately work together
to protect their baby.
In conclusion, the reactions of Juana and Kino are different, shown emphatically by the
structural contrast of Kino’s emotionally charged and ineffectual reaction with the sensible and
measured reaction that follows when the focus shifts to Juana. I agree with the student that Kino
is depicted as being more unhelpful and impractical in trying to save his son’s life, whereas
Juana is ostensibly presented as the sole character that tries to save Cayotito’s life.

8,"""I was hoping the hyena would stay under the tarpaulin. I was disappointed. Nearly
immediately it leapt over the zebra and onto the stern bench. There it turned on
itself a few times, whimpering and hesitating. I wondered what it was going to do
next. The answer came quickly: it brought its head low and ran around the zebra in
a circle, transforming the stern bench, the side benches and the cross bench just
beyond the tarpaulin into a twenty-five-foot indoor track. It did one lap-two-threefour-five-and onwards, non-stop, till I lost count. And the whole time, lap after lap, it
went yip yip yip yip yip in a high-pitched way.
My reaction, once again, was very slow. I was seized by fear and could only watch.
The beast was going at a good clip, and it was no small animal. The beating of its
legs against the benches made the whole boat shake, and its claws were loudly
clicking on their surface. Each time it came from the stern I tensed. It was hairraising enough to see the thing racing my way; worse still was the fear that it would
keep going straight.
After a number of laps it stopped short at the stern bench and crouched, directing
its gaze downwards, to the space below the tarpaulin. It lifted its eyes and rested
them upon me. The look was nearly the typical look of a hyena – blank and frank,
jaw hanging open, big ears sticking up rigidly, eyes bright and black. I prepared for
my end. For nothing. It started running in circles again. When an animal decides to do something, it can do it for a very long time. All
morning the hyena ran in circles going yip yip yip yip yip. Every time the hyena
paused at the stern bench, my heart jumped. And as much as I wanted to direct my
attention to the horizon, to where my salvation lay, it kept straying back to this
maniacal beast.
Things ended in typical hyena fashion. It stopped at the stern and started
producing deep groans interrupted by fits of heavy panting. I pushed myself away
on the oar till only the tips of my feet were holding on to the boat. The animal
hacked and coughed. Abruptly it vomited. A gush landed behind the zebra. The
hyena dropped into what it had just produced. It stayed there, shaking and whining
and turning around on itself, exploring the furthest confines of animal anguish. It
did not move from the restricted space for the rest of the day.""","""AQA 2023 P1Q4 A student said, “This part of the story, where the hyena behaves wildly, is funny rather
than frightening. The writer suggests that the hyena is actually no serious threat to Pi.”
To what extent do you agree?
In your response, you could:
• consider your impressions of how the hyena behaves
• evaluate how the writer presents the threat of the hyena to Pi
• support your response with references to the text.""","The student’s opinion is understandable, as the hyena’s actions in this extract do seem absurd and even ridiculous at times. However, I only partly agree with the statement. While the hyena’s behaviour may be comical on the surface, the writer also presents it as unstable, unpredictable, and deeply unsettling. The humour is undercut by the constant sense of threat Pi feels, even if the animal never actually attacks him in this moment.

The most obviously humorous aspect of the hyena’s behaviour is the way it runs “in circles” around the boat, turning it into what Pi describes as a “twenty-five-foot indoor track.” This comparison makes the hyena seem more like a confused animal in a zoo enclosure than a predator. Repetition is used structurally to emphasise the pointlessness of the action, with Pi counting “one lap–two–three–four–five–and onwards.” The reader is made to feel that the hyena is stuck in a loop, not calculating or focused. The repetition mimics its mindless energy and creates an image that is more absurd than threatening.

This absurdity is heightened through sound. The onomatopoeic “yip yip yip yip yip” is repeated across several lines, giving the scene a rhythm that feels comic. The sound is high-pitched and irritating, not deep or aggressive like a roar. In fact, the more it is repeated, the more ridiculous it becomes. This suggests the hyena is frenzied and panicking rather than preparing to attack. Pi himself notes that this continues “all morning,” which transforms the noise into something almost theatrical — a kind of strange, animal performance rather than a sign of danger.

Despite this, the writer still maintains an atmosphere of fear through Pi’s perspective. Pi admits he is “seized by fear” and that he tenses every time the hyena approaches the stern. The verbs “tensed” and “seized” show that, regardless of how silly the hyena may seem, Pi perceives it as a real and immediate threat. The contrast between the animal’s bizarre actions and Pi’s terror reminds the reader that humour does not eliminate danger — instead, it builds a more complex mood of unease. The fact that Pi “prepared for [his] end” when the hyena briefly makes eye contact with him reinforces that the threat still feels real.

Later in the extract, the scene becomes grotesque. The hyena’s anticlimactic collapse is described in unpleasant detail: “it vomited… it dropped into what it had just produced.” The use of violent physical verbs like “hacked,” “coughed,” and “vomited” creates a disturbing image. While some might find the scene disgusting or darkly humorous, it also reveals the hyena’s complete physical and emotional breakdown. The phrase “exploring the furthest confines of animal anguish” uses emotive language to show that the hyena is in an unstable, almost pitiful state — still unpredictable, and therefore still dangerous.

In conclusion, while the hyena’s behaviour is at times exaggerated and may appear comical, the overall tone remains tense and unnerving. Through repetition, onomatopoeia and grotesque imagery, the writer presents the hyena as not so much funny or frightening, but something in between — unstable, irrational, and capable of danger. I mostly disagree with the student’s statement because although the hyena’s actions seem absurd, the threat to Pi remains present throughout."
